# A basic neural network

## This is the first project assignment of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

In this project a neural network is built from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real world dataset. 
Building the network from the ground up (without any additional frameworks like Tensorflow oder Keras) is important for 
a fundamental understanding of important concepts like gradient descent and backpropagation.

These concepts are key in order to understand how neural networks are functioning and a necessary foundation before moving to 
higher level frameworks like Tensorflow.
